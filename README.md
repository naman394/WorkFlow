# 🍪 Cookie-Licking Detector

An AI-powered solution to tackle the "Reserved Issue" problem in open source projects.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In open source projects, contributors often "claim" issues by commenting ("I'll work on this", "please assign this to me"), then never deliver. This phenomenon, known as "cookie-licking", frustrates newcomers, slows progress, and makes issues appear "taken" when they're actually available.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

Our Cookie-Licking Detector uses predictive AI to:

- **Detect** issues that have been claimed but show no progress
- **Analyze** contributor behavior patterns and reliability scores  
- **Intervene** with intelligent nudging (not just bot messages)
- **Auto-release** stale claims after configurable grace periods
- **Predict** which claims are likely to succeed or fail

## 🏗️ Architecture
